## Hello! 👋

I'm Edoardo, an engineering student at Politecnico di Milano with a passion for blending creativity and technology to build products people love.

I’ve had the privilege of attending Apple WWDC as a scholar, creating the “Drinking Fountains” app—used by over 100k people to find water resources worldwide—and developing “WopStation,” a platform that simplifies satellite data access for farmers. I’ve also had the honor of speaking at COP28 and the United Nations HQ in New York City.

Always excited by challenging problems and new technologies, I’m currently working on projects with TypeScript and React.
